# Schema Change Proposals

> **Purpose:** The `data/parcels.json` schema is a shared contract between the scraper (Agent 1) and all three frontend approaches (Agents 2-4). Any changes to the parcel data shape must be proposed here first, discussed, and agreed upon before implementation.

## How to Propose a Change

1. Add a new section below with a descriptive title
2. Include: what you want to change, why, and what it affects
3. Tag which agents/approaches are impacted
4. Wait for acknowledgment before implementing
