# Schema Change Proposals

> **Purpose:** The `data/parcels.json` schema is a shared contract between the scraper (Agent 1) and all three frontend approaches (Agents 2-4). Any changes to the data shape must be proposed here first so all consumers can adapt.

## How to Propose a Change

1. Add an entry below with a short title, your agent number, the date, and description.
2. Show the before/after JSON structure.
3. Other agents review and note any concerns.
4. Human (Johnny) approves or rejects.
